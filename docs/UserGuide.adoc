== Introduction

Concierge is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list -r`* : lists all rooms
* **`checkin`**`r/085` : checks in the first active booking of room 085
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Terminology

====
*Some important things that you need to know before using Concierge*

** Room numbers must be a 3-digit number from 001 to 100. For example,
* 001, 050, 074, 100 are valid
* 000, 01, 99, 101 are invalid

** A `Booking` is...
* `Active` if its start and end date includes today's date, inclusively.
* `Upcoming` if its start date is strictly after today's date.
* `Expired` if its end date is strictly before today's date.
* `Outdated` if its start date is strictly before today's date.

** Date format: `d/M/y`
* `d` - Day can be 1 or 2 digits
* `M` - Month can be 1 or 2 digits
* `y` - Year can be 2 or 4 digits (if 2 digits, date is assumed to be in the current century)

** There are 2 guest lists:
* Checked-in guest list contains all the guests who are currently checked-in.
* Archived guest list contains all guests who have ever stayed in the hotel before.
* Since the possibility of returning guests exists, there is no need to synchronize the archived guest list.
(i.e. it is standalone).

====

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Adding a guest: `add`

Adds a guest to the guest list for the purpose of assigning a room +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG] r/ROOM_NUMBER
from/START_DATE to/END_DATE`

[TIP]
A guest can have any number of tags (including 0)

****
* A guest can make an unlimited number of bookings with the hotel, as long as
the booking is valid.
* A guest can make a booking for however long he/ she wants.
* When adding a booking, the guest will *not* be added to the archived guest list or checked-in guest list.
His/ her information will be stored under his/ her booking in the room.
* Expired bookings cannot be added. [red]#Coming in v1.4#
****

[TIP]
A valid booking cannot clash with an existing booking. It must also have a
start date from today onwards.

Example:

`add n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johnsmith@gmail.com t/VIP r/085 from/09/12/18 to/10/12/18`

Add a guest "John Smith" to room 085 for a period of stay from 09/12/18 to 10/12/18.

the checked-in guest list. +
Format: `checkin r/ROOM_NUMBER`

Examples:

* `checkin r/085` +

to the checked-in guest list.

=== Checkout room: `checkout`

Checks out the room's first (i.e. earliest) booking, or its booking with the specified start date. +
[TIP]
A booking can be uniquely identified by its start date.
[TIP]
`checkout` 's intended use is the deletion of any booking.
 This means that you can delete a non-checked-in booking using `checkout`.

Depending on whether the guest still has other checked-in bookings, either of the following can occur: +

* If the guest does not have any other checked-in bookings, then he/she will be removed from the checked-in
guest list and added to the archived guest list.
* If the guest still has other checked-in bookings, he/she will *not* be removed from the checked-in guest list,
but will be added to the archived guest list.

Format: `checkout r/ROOM_NUMBER [from/START_DATE]`

Examples:

* `checkout r/085` +
Checks out room 085 and the room's first booking.
* `checkout r/085 from/01/11/18`
Checks out the booking with start date 01/11/18 from room 085.

=== Reassigning a guest to another room : `reassign`

Reassigns a booking from one room to another.

* The new room is different from the original.
* Neither the booking nor any of the new room's bookings are expired.
* The booking does not overlap with any of the new room's bookings.
* If the booking ends the same day the new room's first booking starts, the new room's first booking cannot be checked-in.
* If the booking starts the same day the new room's first booking ends, the booking cannot be checked-in.

Format: `reassign r/ROOM_NUMBER from/START_DATE`

Examples:

* `reassign r/085 from/01/11/18 nr/086` +
Reassigns the booking with start date 01/11/18 in room 085 to room 086.

into the same folder as the Concierge.jar file.
Alternatively, create a new passwords.json and use SHA-256 Hash to generate
the hash for your password. You can use this website for this: https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/
