== Introduction

Concierge is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list -r`* : lists all rooms
* **`checkin`**`r/085` : checks in the first active booking of room 085
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Terminology

====
*Some important things that you need to know before using Concierge*

** Room numbers must be a 3-digit number from 001 to 100. For example,
* 001, 050, 074, 100 are valid
* 000, 01, 99, 101 are invalid

** A `Booking` is...
* `Active` if its start and end date includes today's date, inclusively.
* `Upcoming` if its start date is strictly after today's date.
* `Expired` if its end date is strictly before today's date.
* `Outdated` if its start date is strictly before today's date.

** Date format: `d/M/y`
* `d` - Day can be 1 or 2 digits
* `M` - Month can be 1 or 2 digits
* `y` - Year can be 2 or 4 digits (if 2 digits, date is assumed to be in the current century)

** There are 2 guest lists:
* Checked-in guest list contains all the guests who are currently checked-in.
* Archived guest list contains all guests who have ever stayed in the hotel before.
* Since the possibility of returning guests exists, there is no need to synchronize the archived guest list.
(i.e. it is standalone).

====

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

// tag::add[]
=== Adding a guest: `add`

Adds a booking associated with a guest, room and booking period. +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG] r/ROOM_NUMBER from/START_DATE to/END_DATE`

[TIP]
A guest can have any number of tags (including 0)

****
* A valid booking cannot clash with an existing booking. It must also have a
  start date from today onwards (not outdated).
* A guest can make an unlimited number of bookings with the hotel.
* When adding a booking, the guest will *not* be added to the archived guest list or checked-in guest list.
His/ her information will be stored under his/ her booking in the room.
****

 This command requires a login.

Example: `add n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johnsmith@gmail.com t/VIP r/085
from/17/12/18
to/19/12/18`

Add a guest "John Smith" to room 085 for the period of stay from 17/12/18 to
19/12/18.

.Adding an active booking
image::AddCommand-userguide-active.png[width="800"]

When a booking is added and it starts today (i.e. it is active), then you can
 preview the booking on the left room pane.

.Adding an inactive booking (i.e. booking is in the future)
image::AddCommand-userguide-notactive.png[width="800"]

When a booking is added and it starts on a future date, then it can only be
viewed by clicking on the relevant room. It can be found in the "All other
bookings" section.
// end::add[]

=== Adding a guest: `addx` [red]#Coming in v2.0#

Adds a guest to the guest list NOT for the purpose of assigning a room (perhaps add to archived guest list) +
Format: `addx n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG]...`

Example:

`addx n/guest p/98765432 e/johntan@hotmail.com t/bro`

=== Check-in room: `checkin`

Checks in the room's first active booking.
[TIP]
Expired and upcoming bookings *cannot* be checked-in.

Upon checking in the room's first active booking, the guest who made the booking will be added to
the checked-in guest list. +
Format: `checkin r/ROOM_NUMBER`

 This command requires a login.

Examples:

Checks in room 085, marks room 085's current booking as checked-in, and adds the guest who made the booking
to the checked-in guest list.

=== Checkout room: `checkout`

Checks out the room's first (i.e. earliest) booking, or its booking with the specified start date. +
[TIP]
A booking can be uniquely identified by its start date.
[TIP]
`checkout` 's intended use is the deletion of any booking.
 This means that you can delete a non-checked-in booking using `checkout`.

Depending on whether the guest still has other checked-in bookings, either of the following can occur: +

* If the guest does not have any other checked-in bookings, then he/she will be removed from the checked-in
guest list and added to the archived guest list.
* If the guest still has other checked-in bookings, he/she will *not* be removed from the checked-in guest list,
but will be added to the archived guest list.

Format: `checkout r/ROOM_NUMBER [from/START_DATE]`

 This command requires a login.

Examples:

* `checkout r/085` +
Checks out room 085 and the room's first booking.
* `checkout r/085 from/01/11/18`
Checks out the booking with start date 01/11/18 from room 085.

=== Reassigning a guest to another room : `reassign`

Reassigns a booking from one room to another.

** You can reassign a booking only if all of the following conditions are met:
* The new room is different from the original.
* Neither the booking nor any of the new room's bookings are expired.
* The booking does not overlap with any of the new room's bookings.
* If the booking ends the same day the new room's first booking starts, the new room's first booking cannot be checked-in.
* If the booking starts the same day the new room's first booking ends, the booking cannot be checked-in.

Format: `reassign r/ROOM_NUMBER from/START_DATE`

 This command requires a login.

Examples:

* `reassign r/085 from/01/11/18 nr/086` +
Reassigns the booking with start date 01/11/18 in room 085 to room 086.

//tag::find[]
=== Locating guests and rooms : `find`

Finds guests or rooms, depending on the input flag and the keyword filters.

Format: `find [flag] FILTERS`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Guests names and tags matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

* <<Reassigning a guest to another room : `reassign`, `reassign`>>

Example: `login user/damithz pw/forgotpassword`

.Without login, Concierge cannot be cleared
image::LogInCommand-notsignedin.png[width="600"]

.Login with a valid account
image::LogInCommand-loginsuccess.png[width="600"]

.After sign in, `clear` command can now be executed
image::LogInCommand-clearsuccess.png[width="600"]

==== Adding a new account

 Currently, Concierge does not have a feature for users to add an account via
the app. The reason is because we only _read_ from the password file.
Nevertheless, for the adventurous users who want to create their own
accounts, this sub-section will be useful.

* Step 1: Open the `passwords.json` file, which should be in the same
folder as your Concierge.jar file.

.The `passwords.json` file stores a list of hashed passwords
image::LogInCommand-passwordsfile.png[width="900"]

* Step 2: Concierge uses SHA-256 password hashing. This hash can be
generated using this https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/[tool].

.Enter your password in the field to generate the hash
image::LogInCommand-generatehash.png[width="900"]

[NOTE]
 Concierge was designed to work with alphanumeric usernames and passwords in
 mind. Do not enter symbols (!, @, %...)

* Step 3: Add the entry to the `passwords.json` file. Note that entries are
separate with a comma.
Format: `"username" : "hashedPassword"`

.A new account with username "newUser" and password "mySecurePassw0rd" has been added
image::LogInCommand-addpasswordentry.png[width="900"]

* Step 4: Close and reload the Concierge application, and your new account
will be recognised.

.User is now able to sign in with the new account
image::LogInCommand-newloginsuccess.png[width="900"]

=== Logout : `logout`

Logs out of the Concierge application. +
Format: `logout`

* The special classes of commands (as documented in <<Login : `login`,
login>>) can no longer be
executed.
* The `logout` command will erase the command history, so users cannot undo/
redo commands executed before the logout.
** This achieves the same effect as closing and re-opening Concierge in the
midst of a sign-in session.

Example: `logout`

image::LogOutCommand-success.png[width="400"]

// end::loginlogout[]

=== Selecting a guest : `select`

Selects the guest or room identified by the index number used in the displayed list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects the guest or room and displays its information in the detailed panel on the right.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list -g` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd guest in the displayed list.
* `list -r` +
`select 100` +
Selects the 100th room in the displayed list.

=== Provide Room Service: `service`

Charges a room service to a room  +
Format: `service r/ROOM_NUMBER no/ITEM_NUMBER [c/COST]`

****
* ITEM_NUMBER refers to the number in the menu given to each type of service offered by the hotel.
* This could be room service, on-demand video streaming, bath supplies, mini bar, etc.
* The cost can be specified as well, if the guest is to be charged an amount that is
  different from the cost in the menu. Note that the cost has to follow a strict format
  such as 100.00, i.e. with two decimal places. The dollar part of the cost should also
  not exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
* Any expenses added with this command will be accounted for under the Expenses portion
  of the respective rooms.
* Only occupied rooms (i.e. rooms with checked-in guests) can have expenses charged to it.
* The default `Menu` that comes with Concierge consists of the following items. Items
  may be modified, added, or removed through `concierge.xml`.
** *RS01* -- Room service: Red wine -- $50.00
** *RS02* -- Room service: Beef steak -- $70.00
** *RS03* -- Room service: Thai massage -- $100.00
** *MB01* -- Minibar: Coca cola -- $3.00

****
* A room under maintenance does not affect any of the other system operations.

* or ask the guest to wait until the maintenance is over (e.g. leave luggage at hotel and talk a walk outside).
