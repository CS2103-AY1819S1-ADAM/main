== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ConciergeChangedEvent` when Concierge(TM) data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ConciergeParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a guest) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Concierge(TM) data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Guest>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Concierge(TM)`, which `Guest` can reference. This would allow `Concierge(TM)` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Guest` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save Concierge(TM) data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedConcierge`.
It extends `Concierge(TM)` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `conciergeStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedConcierge#commit()` -- Saves the current Concierge(TM) state in its history.
* `VersionedConcierge#undo()` -- Restores the previous Concierge(TM) state from its history.
* `VersionedConcierge#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone Concierge(TM) state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitConcierge()`, `Model#undoConcierge()` and `Model#redoConcierge()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedConcierge` will be initialized with the initial Concierge(TM) state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Concierge(TM) state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th guest in Concierge(TM). The `delete` command calls `Model#commitConcierge()`, causing the modified state of Concierge(TM) after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `conciergeStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Concierge(TM) state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new guest. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitConcierge()`, causing another modified Concierge(TM) state to be saved into the `conciergeStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitConcierge()`, so Concierge(TM) state will not be saved into the `conciergeStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the guest was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoConcierge()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Concierge(TM) state, and restores Concierge(TM) to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Concierge(TM) state, then there are no previous Concierge(TM) states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoConcierge()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoConcierge()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Concierge(TM) to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `conciergeStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Concierge(TM) state, then there are no undone Concierge(TM) states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoConcierge()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify Concierge(TM), such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitConcierge()`, `Model#undoConcierge()` or `Model#redoConcierge()`. Thus, the `conciergeStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitConcierge()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `conciergeStateList`, all Concierge(TM) states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Concierge(TM).
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the guest being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Concierge(TM) states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedConcierge`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== AddCommand

The `add` command is used by the receptionist to add the guest to the hotel,
and assign him a room.

==== Current Implementation
We currently accept a `Guest`, `RoomNumber` and `BookingPeriod`
as parameters for the `AddCommand` constructor.

An example of its usage:
* `add n/Madith p/83141592 e/madith@themyth.com a/Recluse Street -r 041 from/
29/10/2018 to/ 03/11/2018`

The parsing of the `AddCommand` is very similar to what was already
implemented in AddressBook4. More parameters were added, namely the
`RoomNumber` and `BookingPeriod`. These are parsed to create the respective
objects - `Guest`, `RoomNumber` and `BookingPeriod`.

As in AddressBook4, the `Logic` component parses the `AddCommand`, and the
`Model` handles its execution.

* In the `Model`, the `Guest` is _no longer_ added to Concierge(TM). It was
previously the case in AddressBook4.
* A new `Booking` object is created with the `Guest` and `BookingPeriod` as
its parameters.
* This `Booking` is then added to the `Room` with the `RoomNumber` specified.

An Activity Diagram for the execution of `execute(Model model, CommandHistory
 history)` is shown below.

image::AddCommand-activity-diagram.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to recognise a `BookingPeriod` from the user input?

The relationship we defined between a `Room` and `Booking` is that a `Room`
has a `Booking`. The `Booking` then comprises a `Guest` and `BookingPeriod`
field.

However, it is troublesome to enter a `BookingPeriod` manually, as it entails
 entering two dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Enter the start and end date of
`BookingPeriod`
** Pros: Very easy to parse. The checks for dates all occur at the
`BookingPeriod` class. There is no conversion needed to track the exact date,
 which is useful to check for the booking status of rooms on a particular date.
** Cons: Not user-friendly. Requires user to enter two dates.

* **Alternative 2 (coming in v1.5):** Enter the start date and a duration
** Pros: Very intuitive and user-friendly.
** Cons: The duration has to be parsed and converted to an end date. The
current implementation of `BookingPeriod` does not support this method.

===== Aspect: Reducing redundancy in `UniqueGuestList` and `UniqueRoomList`

As one can observe in the current implementation, `Guest` is added to the
guest list of Concierge(TM) and is then used again to make a `Booking`. The
`Booking` is added to Concierge(TM), this time under the room list.

There is a repetition of the addition of a guest - it is added to both the
`UniqueGuestList` and the `UniqueRoomList`. In an actual use case of
Concierge(TM), we rarely if not never add the `Guest` to the `UniqueGuestList`
without assigning him a `Room` under the `UniqueRoomList`.

In its cleanest case, the structure of Concierge(TM) would be as follows:

Concierge(TM) contains a `UniqueRoomList`. Each room in this internalList may
consist multiple `Booking` s. Each `Booking` is tagged to one `Guest` and one
`BookingPeriod`. An illustration of this relationship is shown below.

image::addCommand-class-diagram.png[width="800"]

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep both the `UniqueGuestList` and
`UniqueRoomList`
** Pros: Maintaining a separate list of guests currently allows us to quickly
 check for the `DuplicateGuestException`.
** Cons: The list is only useful for guest-specific functions. To find the
`Room` the guest is assigned to, we still have to work through the
`UniqueRoomList`.

* **Alternative 2:** Remove the `UniqueGuestList`
** Pros: Remove the redundancy in maintaining two lists. Improved storage space.
** Cons: Unable to quickly check for a `DuplicateGuestException`. However, we
 must also note that the `DuplicateGuestException` is something we may want
 to remove in future iterations. That is, a `Guest` should be able to make
 multiple `Booking` s. However, this would lead to more complications -
 during `checkout`, we have to look through all the `Booking` s and ensure
 that the `Guest` is no longer needed in the Concierge(TM) system. Only then can
 we move the `Guest` to an archive or remove him from the system.

==== Aspect: Reduce coupling between `Room` and `Guest`

Semantically, we can observe a strong coupling and dependency between `Room`
and `Guest`. A `Room` contains a `Guest`, and a `Guest` also has a `Room`.
This coupling is more binding than that between `UniqueGuestList` and
`UniqueRoomList` as described above.

Having to keep track of both sides of the coin introduces an unnecessary
coupling between these two classes. Our team decided to record `Guest` in
`Room` instead of recording `Room` in `Guest`. The difference between these
two selections lies in the time needed for different operations.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `Guest` as a field in `Room`
** Pros: An efficient for managing bookings. All the `Booking` s tied to a
particular `Room` can be put together, allowing the Receptionist to determine
 if a `Room` can be booked in `O(m)` time, where `m` is the number of
 `Booking` s in a room. In the context of Concierge(TM), there is a rare chance
 that a `Room` will have a large number of advanced bookings being made.
** Cons: It is difficult to find the `Room` given the `Guest`. When a
`Guest` has made and advanced booking and wishes to cancel it, we have
to search through all the `Room` s for bookings on the particular date
tagged to the `Guest`. However, given the `BookingPeriod` of the
`Guest`, this can be done in `O(1)` time since the number of `Room` s is
constant.
*** For most uses of Concierge(TM), we expect `Guest` s to be aware of their
 `Room` s. When the `Guest` calls for room service, we can tag the service
 to the `Room` instead.

* **Alternative 2:** Add `Room` as a field in `Guest`
** Pros: Very customer-centric design. Allows the receptionist to find the
`Room` or `Booking` details of a `Guest` in `O(1)` time.
** Cons: Making a new `Booking` with a new `Guest` is highly inefficient.
Because the `Booking` information is now scattered across individual
`Guest` s, the search space for `Concierge(TM)` to decide if a `Room` is free to
book is the entire `UniqueGuestList`.

// tag::list[]
=== Rooms List Feature
The rooms list feature builds upon, and reuses functions from the ;originally implemented ListCommand.

The Activity UML Diagram for the current implementation of ListCommand is as follows:

image::ListCommandUml.png[width="600"]

==== Current Implementation
The list function is facilitated by a modified `ListCommand` class, of which the input from the CommandBox is parsed by a `ListCommandParser` class.

The list function now requires a flag after the 'list' command. Below are the two allowed list commands:

* `list -g` - Lists all guests.
* `list -cg` - Lists all checked-in guests.
* `list -r` - Lists all rooms.

A `ListCommandParser` class was created to obtain and compare the flags from inputs, which required a different approach to the rest of the commands. The input string is simply split using a String function, obtaining an array of strings, of which the flags will be at index 1.

Modification of existing FXML files, and creation of new FXML files was done to achieve separate listing of guests and rooms, and the browser panel was replaced with a panel to focus on, and display more detailed information on the selected guest/room.

In order to stack the UI elements on top of one another to reuse and display the separate lists under the same column, modifications were made to the `MainWindow.fxml` file.
The GuestListPanel and RoomListPanel each has a "VBox" element encapsulating them, which visibility is toggled and the element itself enabled or disabled based on the flag that was obtained from the parser. This feature extends to the GuestDetailedPanel and RoomDetailedPanel and is achieved in the same way.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to display each list
* **Alternative 1 :** Maintain two columns on the MainWindow UI to display both rooms and guests
** Pros: Easier to modify UI by adding on instead of modifying and replacing, and modifications in the future will not be too tedious.
** Cons: UI looks cluttered with an empty column when not displaying the other, not an efficient use of screen space.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Separately display the two lists within the same MainWindow UI space/column.
** Pros: Cleaner looking, fully utilises empty spaces. Better visual feedback from commands as inputs.
** Cons: Requires heavy modification of MainWindow UI files, future features must stick with the restriction of having a list of either guests or rooms.

// end::list[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Feature
The Find feature expands upon the originally implemented FindCommand, allowing for the searching of both rooms and guests, with several filters.

The Activity UML Diagram for the current implementation of FindCommand is as follows:

image::FindCommandUml.png[width="600"]

==== Current Implementation
The find function is facilitated by a modified `FindCommand` class, of which the input from the CommandBox is parsed by a `FindCommandParser` class.

The find function now has the ability to find either guests or rooms. The starting commands for the find function with flags are as follows:

* `find -g` - Find guests.
* `find -cg` - Find checked-in guests.
* `find -r` - Find rooms.

The above command must be followed up by at least 1 filter, and they are as follows:

Guest Filters (-g):

* `n/ - Name`
* `p/ - Phone Number`
* `e/ - Email Address`
* `t/ - Tags`

Room Filters (-r):

* `r/ - Room Number`
* `c/ - Capacity`
* `t/ - Room Tags`
* `n/ - Name of guest with bookings`

The following are filters for room bookings. The flags cannot be mixed.
The flags can be used independently, or with a from/to specified date.
Input dates must be in DD/MM/YY format.

* `-hb - Has Bookings Flag`
* `-nb - No Bookings Flag`
* `from/ - Booking Start Date`
* `to/ - Booking End Date`

The FindCommandParser uses a tokenizer to obtain the individual arguments/filters, whether the filter is present or not. If a filter is present, the input that precedes the filter prefix will be used to create the individual predicate class.

These predicate classes are collected into a list of predicates before they are combined and merged in the FindCommand class. The combined final predicate is then passed to the Model Manager to filter the guest/room list, and a listingChangedEvent is called to update the UI elements.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: OR/AND Searching
When searching, a few things have to be considered. Does the filter specified have an OR relationship with one another, or an AND relationship.
An example is this: find -g n/Alex t/VIP, this can be interpreted in two ways. Finding guests with name as "Alex" AND with tag "VIP", or name "Alex" or tag "VIP.
// end::find[]

=== Command Archive feature
Given below is the UML diagram for the `CommandArchive` Class:

image::CommandArchive_class.png[width="280"]

Given below is the UML diagram for the `CommandHistory` Class:

image::CommandHistory_class.png[width="345"]

==== Current Implementation

The Command Archive mechanism is facilitated by `CommandArchive`.
It utilises the `userInputHistory` to extract the latest command that the user has input and passes the `inputString`
to `stringToFile` method in `CommandArchive` class. The `inputString` is then appended to the `CommandFile.txt` file. Additionally, it
implements the following operations:

* `StringBuilder()` -- The main operations of the `StringBuilder` are the `append` and `insert` methods which can
be overloaded to accept data of any type. The `append` method always adds these characters at the end of the builder.
This operation can be found in `CommandHistory`.
* `toString()` -- Converts the StringBuilder object into a string named `inputString` so it can be passed to the
`CommandArchive` class. This operation can be found in `CommandHistory`.
* `getLogger()` -- Creates `LOGGER` so that it can log any `IOExceptions` that are caught in the catch blocks of the
methods found in `stringToFile` method of `CommandArchive`.
* `substring()` -- Extracts the latest command from the `userInputHistory`. This is required because the
`userInputHistory` appends all the older commands into the LinkedList as well. This is done by looking for the first
 newLine character occurrence of the `inputString`. The substring is then extracted as `latestUserCommand`.
This operation can be found in `CommandArchive`.
 * `simpleDateFormat()` -- Creates a `timeStamp` in DD/MM/YYY format that can later be appended to
`latestUserCommand`. This operation can be found in `CommandArchive`.
 * `fileWriter` -- Writes the stream of characters (which is `latestUserCommand`) to `commandHistory` file. This will
eventually be the output that is written into `commandFile.txt` via `PrintWriter`. The `PrintWriter` also appends
`timeStamp` to the latest entry (which is eventually `timeStamp` + `latestUserCommand`). This operation can be found
in CommandArchive`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to extract userInputHistory

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `userInputHistory` is first put into a `stringBuilder` and then converted to
string to then pass to `CommandArchive`.
** Pros:
1. Easy to implement because `StringBuilder` can utilise `append` and `insert` methods, which can be overloaded
to accept any data.
2. Faster than `StringBuffer` under most implementations.
3. StringBuilder is mutable while String is immutable.
** Cons: String is more optimised especially if you don't need the extra features of `StringBuilder`
* **Alternative 2:** Create a KeyLogger class that implements KeyListener to capture userInput.
** Pros: It is more secure and can only be accessed for audits and other administrative access purposes and is hidden
from the user.
** Cons:
1. If implemented wrongly, it will become a global KeyLogger that captures userInput outside of application.
2. Does not utilise the existing infrastructure and data found in the base level program class `CommandHistory` and
hence would require more effort to implement.

=== Room Check-in/Checkout feature
==== Current Implementation

The room check-in and checkout features makes use of `UniqueRoomList`.
The logic that supports the check-in and checkout operations mainly reside in the `Concierge(TM)` and `Room` classes.

* `UniqueRoomList#checkin(RoomNumber)` -- Checks in the first booking of the room identified by the given room number
* `UniqueRoomList#checkout(RoomNumber)` -- Checks out the first booking of the room identified by the given room number
* `UniqueRoomList#checkout(RoomNumber, LocalDate)` -- Checks out the room's booking whose start date matches the given date

[NOTE]
Active booking refers to a booking that includes today's date. +
First booking refers to the earliest (i.e. first in chronological order).
[NOTE]
A room can be checked out regardless of its checked-in status. Thus, `checkout` doubles as a command to delete bookings.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#checkInRoom` and `Model#checkoutRoom` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the check-in/checkout mechanism behaves at each step.

Assuming there is a booking already added to room 001,

* The user executes `checkin r/001` when the guest arrives.
. The `checkin` command takes in a `RoomNumber` argument and calls `Model#checkInRoom` as such: `Model.checkInRoom(roomNumber)`
. `ModelManager#checkInRoom` (which implements Model) will call `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom`
. `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom` will call `UniqueRoomList#getRoom` to get the room using its RoomNumber
. `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom` will call `Room#checkIn`
. `Room#checkIn` will
.. throw `NoBookingException` if the room has no bookings
.. throw `ExpiredBookingException` if the room's first booking is expired
.. throw `InactiveBookingCheckInException` if the room's first booking is not active
.. throw `BookingAlreadyCheckedInException` if the room's first booking is already checked in
.. update the first booking as checked-in if no exceptions were thrown
. `VersionedConcierge#checkinRoom` will call `VersionedConcierge#addCheckedInGuestIfNotPresent`
. `VersionedConcierge#addCheckedInGuestIfNotPresent` will add the checked-in guest to the checked-in guest list
 if he/she is not already in it

* The user executes `checkout r/001` when the guest leaves.
. The `checkout` command takes in a `RoomNumber` argument and calls `Model#checkoutRoom` as such: `Model.checkoutRoom(roomNumber)`
. `ModelManager#checkoutRoom` (which implements Model) will call `VersionedConcierge#checkoutRoom`
. `VersionedConcierge#checkoutRoom` will call `UniqueRoomList#getRoom` to get the room using its RoomNumber
. `VersionedConcierge#checkoutRoom` will call `Room#getBookings#getFirstBooking` to get the first booking of the room
. `VersionedConcierge#checkoutRoom` will call its own overloaded method, which calls `Room#checkout` with the first booking
. `Room#checkout` will
.. throw `BookingNotFoundException` if the room's booking does not exist
.. delete the room's first booking
. `VersionedConcierge#checkoutRoom` will call `VersionedConcierge#removeCheckedInGuest`
 to remove the guest from the checked-in guest list if he/she does not have any other bookings
. `VersionedConcierge#checkoutRoom` will call `VersionedConcierge#addGuest`
 to add the guest to the archived guest list if he/she does not already exists in it

The following sequence diagram shows how to CheckinCommand operations works:

image::CheckinCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1280"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Deletion of bookings

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `checkout` to delete any booking.
** Pros: `checkout` doubles as a delete booking feature, so no need for a `deletebooking` command.
** Cons: Not very natural, as `checkout` implies checking out a checked-in booking.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `checkout` to delete only active booking, and create new command `deletebooking` to delete expired and upcoming bookings.
** Pros: More natural, `checkout` can only do what its name implies.
** Cons: Need to implement new command and more methods, to support the same deletion operation but with a different name.

===== Aspect: Immutability of check-in command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `checkIn` a room by creating a new copy of the room
 with the `isCheckedIn` flag of the first booking set to true.
** Pros: Debugging is easy. Consistent with the rest of the application.
** Cons: `checkIn` method becomes unintuitive, since a new room is returned from the operation,
 instead of a void method simply setting the instance property.
* **Alternative 2:** `checkIn` a room by setting the `isCheckedIn` flag of the first booking to true.
** Pros: Check-in method is intuitive, and does not return a new room.
** Cons: Harder to debug. Tests also become troublesome since changes are made to the same referenced room.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::expenses[]
=== Expense, Expenses and ExpenseType
In Concierge(TM), users will be given the feature of tracking the expenditure of each individual
guest, in order to facilitate checkout charges. Hence, the three classes, `Expenses`, `Expense`
and `ExpenseType` have been created for this purpose. In addition, the hotel also has a
`menu` of goods and services available.

==== Current Implementation
`ExpenseType` objects are essentially immutable objects that represent a single item or service
being sold at the hotel. An `ExpenseType` object contains information about its menu number,
usual price, and description. The main purpose of this class is for convenience; users may
charge a customer by simply providing the menu number of the item and the cost and description
of the item will be able to be referenced. `ExpenseType` information is stored in a `Menu`
object, which is then stored on the hard disk, since users should have the ability to modify
the menu manually. The `Menu` object is internally represented with a `HashMap<String, ExpenseType>`,
with the menu number as keys and the `ExpenseType` objects as values. This allows for the
serialisation of the `Menu` into XML, since `HashMap` is supported by JAXB.

* **Alternative 1: Use a List<ExpenseType> to store the menu.** While there may be negligible
differences for a small menu, searching for an `ExpenseType` object still takes linear time
and there may be significant performance drops for a large menu.

An `Expense` object contains information about one individual expenditure by a guest. An
`Expense` object encapsulates the cost, `ExpenseType` of the item bought, and the date and time
of expenditure.

The `Expenses` object is essentially a `List<Expense>`. Every room contains an `Expenses`
object, to represent the collection of all the expenses of the guests in the room.

* **Alternative 1: Use a `List<Expense>` object**: Defining the `Expenses` class allows us
to restrict access to the collection, and only allow certain methods such as adding an
`Expense` or displaying on screen.
* **Alternative 2: Use a `Set<Expense>` object**: Having the expenses ordered (e.g.
chronologically) will be useful for generating a nice view of all the expenses incurred.

Here is a simple UML describing the roles of these classes.

image::expense_uml.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Immutability of Menu
While it is conceivable that the items sold may change from time to time,
for various reasons such as unpopularity or seasonal products, giving users
the ability to add and remove items from the menu may result in more
problems than benefits. We expect that alterations to the menu will not be
performed frequently, and that the majority of our users, receptionists,
will not be required to add and remove items to the menu. The menu also does
not have to be altered during operational hours. Hence, by making
`Menu` immutable, we eliminate the possibility of making accidental or
unwarranted changes to the menu. The only method to modify `Menu` would
thus be through the XML file, which we believe is suitable for these
purposes.

===== Aspect: Immutability of ExpenseType
The `ExpenseType` object is meant to hold the default values of the name and
price of each item. In other words, since an `Expense` object references an
`ExpenseType` object, the `Expense` object is allowed to have a cost that
is different from the cost in the corresponding `ExpenseType` object, to
account for cases such as the guest having a personalised discount due to
the usage of vouchers or certain credit cards. Thus, ExpenseType does not
need to be modified by users in the application. Nonetheless, it is still
possible to modify the default information through editing the XML file.

// end::expense[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Concierge(TM) depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all guests in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ConciergeParser.java[`ConciergeParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ConciergeParser.java[`ConciergeParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in Concierge(TM), but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in Concierge(TM).
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Concierge(TM).java[`Concierge(TM)`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Concierge(TM).java[`Concierge(TM)`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Guest.java[`Guest`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Concierge(TM).java[`Concierge(TM)`] allows you to update a guest, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Guest.java[`Guest`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Concierge(TM).java[`Concierge(TM)`]. Loop through each guest, and remove the `tag` from each guest.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `Concierge(TM)#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your Concierge(TM) application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last guest in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside guest cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/GuestCard.java[the `GuestCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `GuestCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/ConciergeSystemTest.java[`ConciergeSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and ConciergeSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever Concierge(TM) is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of guests when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleConciergeChangedEvent(ConciergeChangedEvent)`] to update the number of guests whenever there are new changes to the concierge.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/ConciergeSystemTest.java[`ConciergeSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of guests status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving Concierge(TM) to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves Concierge(TM) after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for Concierge(TM) storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupConcierge(ReadOnlyConcierge)`, so that Concierge(TM) can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/ConciergeStorage.java[`ConciergeStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlConciergeStorage.java[`XmlConciergeStorage`] class.

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `concierge`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a guest specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first guest to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first guest.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ConciergeParser.java[`ConciergeParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ConciergeParserTest.java[`ConciergeParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ConciergeParser.java[`ConciergeParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ConciergeParserTest.java[`ConciergeParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `GuestCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/GuestCard.java[`GuestCard`] s to display a remark for each guest later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/GuestListCard.fxml[`GuestListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/GuestCard.java[`GuestCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/GuestCardHandle.java[`GuestCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Guest.java[`Guest`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Guest` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Guest.java[`Guest`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Guest.java[`Guest`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` command to modify the remarks field (i.e. the guest will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `concierge.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedGuest` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Guest` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedGuest.java[`XmlAdaptedGuest`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidGuestConcierge.xml`, `typicalGuestsConcierge.xml`, `validConcierge.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `GuestBuilder`
Since `Guest` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/GuestBuilder.java[`GuestBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/guest/Guest.java[`Guest`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/GuestBuilder.java[`GuestBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the guest that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Guest` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalGuests.java[`TypicalGuests`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `GuestCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/GuestCard.java[`GuestCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/GuestCard.java[`GuestCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Guest` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysGuest(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a guest.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
