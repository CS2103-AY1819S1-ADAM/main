== PROJECT: Concierge

== Overview

Concierge is a desktop hotel management application used as an all-in-one
platform for receptionists to handle potential bookings and current guests. The
user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It
is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

[TIP]
Access my contributed code https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github
 .io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=pikulet[here].

*Major enhancement*: added *the ability to login/logout* of the system. +
These were mainly done in
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-2/main/pull/168[#168] and
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-2/main/pull/226[#226].

* What it does: Allows users to login to Concierge and access restricted
commands which mutate the data.
* Significance:  With this feature, hotel managers can implement some level
of access control. Some features more commonly used (`find`, `list`) can
still be accessed without signing in. By combining this with the ability
 to export the command history, the auditing process for rogue commands is
 expedited.
* Highlights:
** The login/logout feature is dynamic and multiple logins/ logouts can
happen in the same session. This means that there is a very close integration
 with the existing commands to verify whether these commands are restricted.
** This feature is complete - there was a need to work with the different
architectural components of Concierge, from command parsing (`Logic`) to login
verification (`Model`) and even password storage (`Storage`).
** The feature attempts to achieve some level of security as the passwords
are strong as a SHA-256 hash instead of in plaintext.
* Credits: The password hash algorithm was taken from
https://www.baeldung.com/sha-256-hashing-java[Baeldung].

*Minor enhancements/ code contributed*:

* https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F11-2/main/pull/133[Renamed] the

 `Booking` packages were not done by me.
