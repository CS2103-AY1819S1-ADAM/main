*Major enhancement*: added *the ability to login/logout* of the system. +
These were mainly achieved in #168 and #226.

* What it does: Allows users to login to Concierge and access restricted
commands which mutate the data.
* Significance:  With this feature, hotel managers can implement some level
of access control. Some features more commonly used (`find`, `list`) can
still be accessed without signing in. By combining this with the ability
 to export the command history, the auditing process for rogue commands is
 expedited.
* Highlights:
** The login/logout feature is dynamic and multiple logins/ logouts can
happen in the same session. This means that there is a very close integration
 with the existing commands to verify whether these commands are restricted.
** This feature is complete - there was a need to work with the different
architectural components of Concierge, from command parsing (`Logic`) to login
verification (`Model`) and even password storage (`Storage`).
** The feature attempts to achieve some level of security as the passwords
are strong as a SHA-256 hash instead of in plaintext.
* Credits: The password hash algorithm was taken from https://www.baeldung
.com/sha-256-hashing-java.

*Minor enhancements/ code contributed*:

* Renamed the existing classes and methods from `Person` to `Guest` [#133]
